The podcast also discusses the analysis of thousands of hours of tutorials online to understand what's being taught in them, and the use of AI to provide intelligent suggestions for next steps and tutorials. The goal is to deeply understand the domain of designers and creative people and combine it with AI for intelligent suggestions. The podcast also touches on the importance of understanding different media types visually and in terms of transcripts and words, and the potential for an assistant to modify the interface to be simpler. Ultimately, the focus is on onboarding new users and making the interface easier for them, while also considering the preferences of users who value mastering complex interfaces and keyboard shortcuts.

Adobe is working on innovative applications of computer vision and machine learning, including scene stitching, sky replacement, foreground/background removal, spatial object-based image search, automatic image captioning, and various other projects. These applications are being developed for different classes of devices and aim to streamline post-production workflows. Project deep fill and sky replacement are two particularly interesting features, allowing for automatic image editing and realistic effects. The concept canvas is being used to assign spatial regions to keywords for image search, giving a sense of ownership over the outcome. Neural networks and GANs are being used to remove objects from scenes and fill in backgrounds automatically, but there are limitations in handling high resolutions and inferring invisible structure behind objects.

The podcast discusses the importance of data sharing and privacy in the development of AI tools, particularly in the context of Adobe's efforts to improve its products. It emphasizes the need for a systematic process to gather and train algorithms, while also respecting customer privacy and obtaining explicit permission before using their data. The podcast also highlights the potential benefits of sharing data, such as understanding customer intent for better recommendations and the quick evolution of the tool. It also touches on the concept of using guardrails and detectors to estimate the competence of AI algorithms, as well as the idea of an ensemble of experts and the importance of gathering diverse training sets of images for AI. Overall, the podcast emphasizes the importance of gathering data and the reasons behind it in the world of AI, and the potential benefits of sharing data with the tool.

The podcast discusses the use of 3D thinking to apply painting styles to videos or still images of people talking, allowing for more realistic and dynamic effects. It also explores the advancements in 3D computer vision algorithms, particularly in the domain of faces, and the potential for more general applications in the future. The podcast also delves into the evolving technology of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR), and their different purposes and market uses. It also touches on the tension between fidelity and adaptation in AR, as well as the potential for adaptive characters in AR technology. Finally, the podcast explores the potential for an explosion of demand for 3D assets driven by AR and real-time animation, and the tools and devices that may help with designing content in this context.

The podcast discusses the importance of designing content, considering new ideas while valuing old ways, and not offending existing users with changes. It emphasizes the balance between convenience and control, as well as the need for evolution and growth in a product. The tool being discussed has evolved and grown, with a breakthrough in simplifying the user interface. It also explores the use of different software options for various project types and the potential of AI for smart defaults and coaching. The need for an educational tool to assist users in understanding different settings and options is highlighted. The conversation briefly touches on the use of poetry before shifting to a different topic.

The podcast discusses the shift from a text-based culture to a visual culture and the impact of visual content on society. It explores the positive and negative effects of visual content, such as the inspiration it can provide for creativity and exploration, as well as the potential harm of holding oneself to unrealistic standards. The podcast also delves into the use of AI to create idealized versions of ourselves and the need for the public to be aware of the potential for manipulation in visual media. It also touches on the historical context of presenting idealized versions of oneself and the impact of social media on shaping alternate realities. Overall, the podcast raises thought-provoking questions about the implications of living in a digital, visually-driven world.

The podcast discusses the importance of internships in research labs, highlighting how they bring new ideas and lead to new publications. It also explores the process of selecting interns, the decision-making process in research labs, and the balance between freedom of choice and impact in project selection.
