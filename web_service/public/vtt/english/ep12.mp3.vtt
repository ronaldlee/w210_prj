00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.850
<v Speaker1>The podcast features Thomas Sandholm, a professor at CMU and co-creator of Libratus, the first A.I.

2
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.920
<v Speaker1>system to be top human players in the game of Heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em.

3
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker1>This game is considered a benchmark for testing AI algorithms for imperfect information game solving.

4
00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker1>In 2017, Libratus beat four expert human players in a 20 day competition at the Rivers Casino, challenging the belief in the importance of human facial expressions and body language in poker.

5
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:47.300
<v Speaker1>The podcast discusses the importance of tells in poker, especially at lower levels of play, and how they become less significant as the game becomes more complex at higher levels.

6
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.500
<v Speaker1>The game of poker involves a large number of strategies and possible actions, requiring abstraction to solve the game tree in an imperfect information game.

7
00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.920
<v Speaker1>Abstraction in games, particularly in poker, is more challenging than in other types of games, and can lead to worse strategies if not done properly.

8
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.220
<v Speaker1>There are different kinds of abstractions in games, such as hands, abstractions and betting strategies than the algorithms used for information and action abstraction.

9
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.200
<v Speaker1>Consider various factors.

10
00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.760
<v Speaker1>The strength of the hand.

11
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.880
<v Speaker1>Information, abstraction and betting actions are all important in playing poker, and playing a lot of hands can reduce the role of luck in the game.

12
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.530
<v Speaker1>No limit.

13
00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:45.100
<v Speaker1>Texas hold'em has a high level of variance and massive swings, requiring statistical significance to be achieved over a large number of hands.

14
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:57.200
<v Speaker1>The podcast also discusses the use of learning methods such as deep learning to aid in poker playing, and the effectiveness of these methods in comparison to non-learning methods.

15
00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:11.350
<v Speaker1>In imperfect information games like poker, the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but also on both players beliefs, making it a complex and challenging game to master.

16
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:21.020
<v Speaker1>The podcast discusses the state of a game and how it is determined by the path of play and belief distributions, not just the cards.

17
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:32.380
<v Speaker1>It explains that perfect information games have a straightforward concept of state and evaluation function, but in games like poker, it is more complicated.

18
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker1>The opponents strategies at the leaf of the search tree are considered in evaluating the game state, leading to a more realistic look ahead search.

19
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.780
<v Speaker1>Look ahead.

20
00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.790
<v Speaker1>Search in imperfect information games is difficult, and techniques like deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search are used to learn the values of states and belief distributions.

21
00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker1>The podcast also delves into the concept of beliefs as outputs, Nash equilibrium and the use of Bayes theorem in game theory.

22
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.260
<v Speaker1>Game Theory is a data free and opponent free approach that focuses on the design of the game, rather than the design of the player.

23
00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.590
<v Speaker1>It is based on rationality and considers what a rational opponent would do and what the player would do if they are rational.

24
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.660
<v Speaker1>Opponent modeling is not a primary focus in game theory, although there has been some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory to exploit weak players.

25
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker1>The decision not to turn on certain strategies is based on the belief that opponents are experts in counter exploitation.

26
00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:54.840
<v Speaker1>The impact of opponents irrational behaviour on beliefs and gains losses is discussed, as well as the concept of unbeatable game theoretic strategies that do not maximally beat the opponent.

27
00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:05.340
<v Speaker1>Repeated games, including the prisoner's dilemma, are also explored, with the understanding that purely repeated games are rare in the real world.

28
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:17.610
<v Speaker1>The text discusses different types of games, including matrix games, stochastic games, and extensive form games, and the concept of reasoning in the tree form of games.

29
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker1>The distinction between two player zero sum games and two player general sum games is highlighted, as well as the concept of Nash equilibrium in non-zero-sum games.

30
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:41.430
<v Speaker1>The podcast discusses the importance of coordination in games like bridge, as well as in negotiations, business, and other real world applications.

31
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:52.030
<v Speaker1>It introduces two start up companies, Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot, which focus on different applications of coordination strategies.

32
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.170

38
00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker1>Many people felt that I posed a threat to the existence of the game, and the speaker received aggressive reactions and even death threats.

39
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker1>Despite AI outperforming humans in chess, the speaker believes that humans can still enjoy poker and that AI has actually made the game richer and more interesting.

40
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.010

45
00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:17.360
<v Speaker1>It delves into the concept of mechanism design, which involves designing rules to achieve desirable outcomes and explores the potential for automated mechanism design in various fields, including politics.

46
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:29.890
<v Speaker1>The speaker acknowledges the existence of impossibility results in mechanism design, but highlights the possibility of carving out islands of possibility within known impossible classes.

47
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker1>The Myerson-satterthwaite theorem is cited as an example of achieving efficient trade despite impossibility results.

48
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:53.620
<v Speaker1>The podcast also touches on the limited success of mechanism design in real world situations, citing the FCC spectrum auctions as an example where game theory principles do not align with practical rules.
