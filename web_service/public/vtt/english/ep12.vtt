00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.850
The podcast features Thomas Sandholm, a professor at CMU and co-creator of Libratus, the first A.I.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.920
system to be top human players in the game of Heads up No Limit Texas Hold'em.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:20.560
This game is considered a benchmark for testing AI algorithms for imperfect information game solving.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:35.040
In 2017, Libratus beat four expert human players in a 20 day competition at the Rivers Casino, challenging the belief in the importance of human facial expressions and body language in poker.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:47.300
The podcast discusses the importance of tells in poker, especially at lower levels of play, and how they become less significant as the game becomes more complex at higher levels.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:58.500
The game of poker involves a large number of strategies and possible actions, requiring abstraction to solve the game tree in an imperfect information game.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:08.920
Abstraction in games, particularly in poker, is more challenging than in other types of games, and can lead to worse strategies if not done properly.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:20.220
There are different kinds of abstractions in games, such as hands, abstractions and betting strategies than the algorithms used for information and action abstraction.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.200
Consider various factors.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.760
The strength of the hand.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:33.880
Information, abstraction and betting actions are all important in playing poker, and playing a lot of hands can reduce the role of luck in the game.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.530
No limit.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:45.100
Texas hold'em has a high level of variance and massive swings, requiring statistical significance to be achieved over a large number of hands.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:57.200
The podcast also discusses the use of learning methods such as deep learning to aid in poker playing, and the effectiveness of these methods in comparison to non-learning methods.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:11.350
In imperfect information games like poker, the value of an information set depends not only on the exact state, but also on both players beliefs, making it a complex and challenging game to master.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:21.020
The podcast discusses the state of a game and how it is determined by the path of play and belief distributions, not just the cards.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:32.380
It explains that perfect information games have a straightforward concept of state and evaluation function, but in games like poker, it is more complicated.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:42.070
The opponents strategies at the leaf of the search tree are considered in evaluating the game state, leading to a more realistic look ahead search.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.780
Look ahead.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.790
Search in imperfect information games is difficult, and techniques like deep learning and Monte Carlo tree search are used to learn the values of states and belief distributions.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:04.450
The podcast also delves into the concept of beliefs as outputs, Nash equilibrium and the use of Bayes theorem in game theory.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:13.260
Game Theory is a data free and opponent free approach that focuses on the design of the game, rather than the design of the player.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.590
It is based on rationality and considers what a rational opponent would do and what the player would do if they are rational.

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:32.660
Opponent modeling is not a primary focus in game theory, although there has been some work on combining opponent modeling with game theory to exploit weak players.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:41.130
The decision not to turn on certain strategies is based on the belief that opponents are experts in counter exploitation.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:54.840
The impact of opponents irrational behaviour on beliefs and gains losses is discussed, as well as the concept of unbeatable game theoretic strategies that do not maximally beat the opponent.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:05.340
Repeated games, including the prisoner's dilemma, are also explored, with the understanding that purely repeated games are rare in the real world.

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:17.610
The text discusses different types of games, including matrix games, stochastic games, and extensive form games, and the concept of reasoning in the tree form of games.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:30.300
The distinction between two player zero sum games and two player general sum games is highlighted, as well as the concept of Nash equilibrium in non-zero-sum games.

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:41.430
The podcast discusses the importance of coordination in games like bridge, as well as in negotiations, business, and other real world applications.

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:52.030
It introduces two start up companies, Strategic Machine and Strategy Robot, which focus on different applications of coordination strategies.

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.170
The use of game theoretic reasoning technologies in optimized markets is also explored.

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:15.060
The podcast delves into the challenges of modeling human behavior in situations like pedestrian and car negotiation in the world of autonomous vehicles, and the potential benefits of automated negotiation in improving traffic flow.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:23.980
It also touches on the difficulty of AI in solving non-zero-sum games and the complexities of collusion in games.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:32.210

00:05:54.170 --> 00:06:02.510
Many people felt that I posed a threat to the existence of the game, and the speaker received aggressive reactions and even death threats.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:13.790
Despite AI outperforming humans in chess, the speaker believes that humans can still enjoy poker and that AI has actually made the game richer and more interesting.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:20.010
The top human players are now incorporating strategies from ash into their own play.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:28.600
The speaker has learned to love the game of poker through working with ash, and did not intend to kill the game of poker.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:42.850
The podcast also delves into the engineering and scientific efforts behind AI's ability to beat human players, emphasizing the importance of performance oriented research and testing algorithms at scale.

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:53.180
The speaker shares their personal experience with organizing the first brains versus AI poker competition, describing it as a wild experience.

The podcast discusses the challenges of applying good ideas at scale, emphasizing the importance of real world implementation.

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:17.360
It delves into the concept of mechanism design, which involves designing rules to achieve desirable outcomes and explores the potential for automated mechanism design in various fields, including politics.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:29.890
The speaker acknowledges the existence of impossibility results in mechanism design, but highlights the possibility of carving out islands of possibility within known impossible classes.

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:38.250
The Myerson-satterthwaite theorem is cited as an example of achieving efficient trade despite impossibility results.

00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:53.620
The podcast also touches on the limited success of mechanism design in real world situations, citing the FCC spectrum auctions as an example where game theory principles do not align with practical rules.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:08:03.360
Overall, the podcast emphasizes the importance of applying insights from mechanism design theory into real world scenarios.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:14.860
The podcast discusses the lack of an optimal bidding strategy in spectrum auctions and the history of AI achievements in game solving, such as AlphaGo and Liberatus.

00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:25.310
The speaker hopes for a new benchmark to drive application independent techniques forward, and is involved in startups related to game solving technology.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:33.920
